#### For Developers:

If you want to set up a development environment for this game, follow these steps:

1. **Set up a Virtual Environment (Optional)**

   You can create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies from your system-wide Python packages. This step is optional but recommended for better project management.

   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Initialize the Virtual Environment (Optional)**

   Activate the virtual environment if you created one. This step is optional if you skipped creating a virtual environment.

   On Windows:
   ```shell
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS and Linux:
   ```shell
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Pygame**
